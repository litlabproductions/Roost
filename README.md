# **Roost**  
### 3D mototcross game based on replicating 250/450cc class dirt bikes.  
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a [***Lit Lab Production***](https://www.litlabproductions.com)
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built with [Unity3D](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) and the 
[Lightweight Render Pipeline](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline/wiki/Lightweight-Render-Pipeline)
***

## Description:
* 3D Motocross Game  
* 100% Physics-Based  
* Low Poly Design  


***

## Design:
* ### Assets:  
    * Bike: [Low Poly Bikes with Rider](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/5-low-poly-dirt-bike-with-rider-108067)
    * Enviornment: [POLYGON - Nature Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/polygon-nature-pack-120152)
* *(Short description of design)
* Physics-Based using an old Unity Asset Store Pack  
    * Asset:     [Randomation Vehicle Physics](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)
    * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
    * My rate of progress is mainly due to these kind words:<br/><br/>
     > "VehicleBalance:  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This script is meant for ***balancing vehicles such as motorcycles***.  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This script is not completely stable, but  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***  

***

## Development:
* ### Assets:  
    * [**Randomation Vehicle Physics**](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rate of progress up to this point is heavily  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reliant on the implmentation of this asset.  
           <br/>
        * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
        * These kind words changed the course of my project:<br/><br/>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I* ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***
