    * Rigged bike model with lightning fast animation updates  
    * Variable system of balance  
        * Auto/manual roll over at speed = x.yz  
    * Automatic/manual transmission  
    * Wheel colliders  
        * Realistic rotation speed/traction  
* New 18.3 Lightweight Render Pipeline  
    * Provides superior mobile performance over default pipeline  
    * PC: 60+ FPS  
    * Mobile: 45+ FPS  
* New 18.3 Terrain System  
    * In-house terrain design using fresh tools  
* Post-Processing V2  
    * Combines complete set of rendered effects into a single pipeline  
* Gorgeous UI  
    * Responsive elements fit for any landscape resolution  
* Low Poly Design 
    * Bike/Character models contain a reduced poly count  
    * Environment models contain a very low poly count  
* Cross-Platform Capability:  
    * Runs on PC, macOS, iOS and Android  


## Design
* ### Assets:  
    * Bike:  
      1. [Low Poly Bikes with Rider](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/5-low-poly-dirt-bike-with-rider-108067)  
      2. [Mobile Dirtbike](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/mobile-dirtbike-56185)  
    
    * UI:  
      1. 
      [Field - Complete Main Menu UI (Lite)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/field-complete-main-menu-ui-lite-129668)  
      2. 
      [Looader - Loading Screen System](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/looader-loading-screen-system-118194)  
      3. 
      [Rain Maker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/environment/rain-maker-2d-and-3d-rain-particle-system-for-unity-34938)  
      4. 
      [Dissolving Shader](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/dissolving-shader-121005)  

    * Enviornment: [POLYGON - Nature Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/polygon-nature-pack-120152)

This is a design explanation.  


## Development
* ### Assets:  
    * [**Randomation Vehicle Physics**](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rate of progress up to this point is heavily  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reliant on the implmentation of this asset.  
           <br/>
        * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
        * These kind words changed the course of my project:<br/><br/>
         > "***VehicleBalance:***  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is meant for* ***balancing vehicles such as motorcycles***.  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is not completely stable, but*  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I* ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***  

This is a development expl.
