# Roost
  
### 3D Motocross Game  
#### Based on replication of 250/450cc dirt bike physics  
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a [***Lit Lab Production***](https://www.litlabproductions.com)
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built with [Unity3D](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) and the 
[Lightweight Render Pipeline](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline/wiki/Lightweight-Render-Pipeline)

## Installation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one build in this project.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's located in the `builds` folder.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[/Roost/Builds/Roost.exe](/Roost/Builds/Roost.exe)

    * Runs on PC, macOS, iOS and Android<br/><br/>


## Design
> When I was first desining this game I began loading a chrome bookmark folder with a outragious number of considerable assets over the course of a couple weeks. Little did I know every assets materials would need to be redesigned from the ground up after purchase from the assets store. This was due to my later implementation of the lightweight render pipeline which demanded all materials fit into its strict mobile guidlines. On the bright side, this increased performance in numerous ways.  
  
* ### Assets:  
    * Bike:  
      [Low Poly Bikes with Rider](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/5-low-poly-dirt-bike-with-rider-108067)

## Development
* ### Assets:  
    * [**Randomation Vehicle Physics**](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)  
         > My unstoppable rate of progress has been heavily reliant
           on the implmentation of this asset
           <br/>
        * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
        * These kind words changed the course of my project:<br/><br/>
         > "***VehicleBalance:***  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is meant for* ***balancing vehicles such as motorcycles***.  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is not completely stable, but*  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I* ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***  


## Looking Forward
* ### To do:
    * Rider model  
        * Animation & texure design  
    * Lean forward, back & side  

    * Graphics settings  
        * Potato to flagship device support  

    * Whip (lean while airborne)  

    * Lap system with time  

    * A.I. opponent  

    * I.A.P. as upgrades  
        * Bikes, parts and graphics  

    * SFX rework  
    
    * Much more
