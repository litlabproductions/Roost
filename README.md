      [Low poly styled rocks](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/low-poly-styled-rocks-43486)  

This is a design explanation.  


## Development
* ### Assets:  
    * [**Randomation Vehicle Physics**](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My unstoppable rate of progress has been heavily reliant  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the implmentation of this asset  
           <br/>
        * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
        * These kind words changed the course of my project:<br/><br/>
         > "***VehicleBalance:***  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is meant for* ***balancing vehicles such as motorcycles***.  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is not completely stable, but*  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I* ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***  

This is a development expl.
