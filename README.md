## Installation

There is only one main source file in the project. It is the [/src/array-mixer.js](/src/array-mixer.js).
The [/src/spec.js](/src/spec.js) is for now the only unit test file in the project.

The `release folder` includes the transpiled ES5 version of the source code, this folder is only avaliable in the []npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/array-mixer). 

## Features
* 3D Motocross Game  
* 100% Physics-Based  
* Low Poly Design  
Run unit tests using this command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Design
* ### Assets:  
    * Bike: [Low Poly Bikes with Rider](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/5-low-poly-dirt-bike-with-rider-108067)
    * Enviornment: [POLYGON - Nature Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/polygon-nature-pack-120152)
     

Would be nice to have some code showing how to reproduce the code, you may use [gist](https://gist.github.com) or [Codepen](https://codepen.io) for uploading your example code.

## Development
* ### Assets:  
    * [**Randomation Vehicle Physics**](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rate of progress up to this point is heavily  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reliant on the implmentation of this asset.  
           <br/>
        * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
        * These kind words changed the course of my project:<br/><br/>
         > "***VehicleBalance:***  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is meant for* ***balancing vehicles such as motorcycles***.  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is not completely stable, but*  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I* ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***  

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/teles/array-mixer/issues) to request a new feature.
Keep in mind `ArrayMixer` intends to be a pure javascript library
Feel free to port it to your favorite framework, such as Angular or VueJs in a new repository.


## Looking Forward

Commit messages should includes GitHub number reference and a imperative easy to understand sentence.

## License

Feel free to use ES2015 and ES2017 features.
Be sure to correctly transpile the source code to ES5.

`ArrayMixer` has its own [ESLint specifications](.eslint.yml) and they need to be followed.
