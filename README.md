There is only one build in this project.  
It's located in the `builds` folder.  
Specifically, [/Roost/Builds/Roost.exe](/Roost/Builds/Roost.exe)


## Features
* 3D Motocross Game  
* 100% Physics-Based  
* Low Poly Design  


## Design
* ### Assets:  
    * Bike: [Low Poly Bikes with Rider](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/5-low-poly-dirt-bike-with-rider-108067)
    * Enviornment: [POLYGON - Nature Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/polygon-nature-pack-120152)
     

This is a design explanation 



## Development
* ### Assets:  
    * [**Randomation Vehicle Physics**](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rate of progress up to this point is heavily  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reliant on the implmentation of this asset.  
           <br/>
        * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
        * These kind words changed the course of my project:<br/><br/>
         > "***VehicleBalance:***  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is meant for* ***balancing vehicles such as motorcycles***.  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is not completely stable, but*  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I* ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***  


This is a development expl.

[gist](https://gist.github.com) or [Codepen](https://codepen.io) for uploading your example code.
Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/teles/array-mixer/issues) to request a new feature.
Keep in mind `ArrayMixer` intends to be a pure javascript library


## Looking Forward

This is a msg about my plans.

## License

Feel free to use ES2015 and ES2017 features.
Be sure to correctly transpile the source code to ES5.

`ArrayMixer` has its own [ESLint specifications](.eslint.yml) and they need to be followed.
