# Roost

#### 3D Mototcross Game Based on Replicating 250/450cc Dirt Bikes  
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a [***Lit Lab Production***](https://www.litlabproductions.com)
<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built with [Unity3D](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies) and the

## Installation

There is only one build in this project.  
It's located in the `builds` folder.  
[/Roost/Builds/Roost.exe](/Roost/Builds/Roost.exe)


## Features
* Physics-Based Movement  
    * Fully responsive suspension simulation defined by 20+ parameters  
    * Rigged bike model with lightning fast animation updates  
    * Variable System of balance  
        * Auto/manual roll over at speed = x.yz  
    * Automatic/Manual Transmission  
    * Wheel colliders  
        * Realistic rotation speed/traction  
* New 18.3 Lightweight Render Pipeline  
    * Provides superior mobile performance over default pipeline  
    * PC: 60+ FPS  
    * Mobile: 45+ FPS  
* New 18.3 Terrain System  
    * In-house terrain design using fresh tools  
* Post-Processing V2  
    * Combines complete set of rendered effects into a single pipeline  
* Gorgeous UI  
    * Responsive elements that handle all landscape resolutions  
* Cross-Platform Capability:  
    * Runs on PC, macOS, iOS and Android  
* Low Poly Design 
    * Bike/Character models contain a reduced poly count 
    * Environment models contain a very low poly count  

## Design
* ### Assets:  
    * Bike: [Low Poly Bikes with Rider](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/5-low-poly-dirt-bike-with-rider-108067)
    * Enviornment: [POLYGON - Nature Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/polygon-nature-pack-120152)
     

This is a design explanation 



## Development
* ### Assets:  
    * [**Randomation Vehicle Physics**](https://github.com/JustInvoke/Randomation-Vehicle-Physics)  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My rate of progress up to this point is heavily  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reliant on the implmentation of this asset.  
           <br/>
        * Developer: Justin Couch, [@JustInvoke](https://github.com/JustInvoke)
        * These kind words changed the course of my project:<br/><br/>
         > "***VehicleBalance:***  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is meant for* ***balancing vehicles such as motorcycles***.  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This script is not completely stable, but*  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I* ***decided to include it anyways in case some people want to experiment with it."***  


This is a development expl.
